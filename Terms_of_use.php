Hey!! Making changes to files again
First reset to last 2 commits then committed again. Checking what happens now

Hey Jatin!!


We'll keep on adding files to this repo. 

Please clone this and start adding random things, like text files, images etc. 

Once this is done, I'll create my own branch and start adding and committing through that branch. 

Then we'll try to understand various concepts (like Rebase) assuming you and I are developers in a company
